    "# The MS COCO classification challenge\n",

    "Razmig KÃ©chichian\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines the multi-class classification challenge on the [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/). It defines the problem, sets the rules of organization and presents tools you are provided with to accomplish the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image has **several** categories of objects to predict, hence the difference compared to the classification problem we have seen on the CIFAR10 dataset where each image belonged to a **single** category, therefore the network loss function and prediction mechanism (only highest output probability) were defined taking this constraint into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapted the MS COCO dataset for the requirements of this challenge by, among other things, reducing the number of images and their dimensions to facilitate processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the companion `ms-coco.zip` compressed directory you will find two sub-directories:\n",
    "- `images`: which contains the images in train (65k) and test (~5k) subsets,\n",
    "- `labels`: which lists labels for each of the images in the train subset only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each label file gives a list of class IDs that correspond to the class index in the following tuple:"

    "## 6. Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the task was, to our eyes, to find the best \"good enough\" model and parameters settings to answer to te question of multi-label classification for this specific dataset. We had the freedom to chose from a large list of pre-trained models, available in the PyTorch library, to help us with our task. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task alone is very time consuming: it requires testing the classification by modifying a couple of parameters, all while also testing between different models to see which one is the best fitted. We understood we were gonna have to make some decisions if we wanted to optimize our work. Our approach was then the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- choosing a couple of models from the PyTorch list \n",
    "- choosing a couple of parameters that we would modify along the testing phase\n",
    "\n",
    "It was very important for us to set these variables, if not, the work would have been too long to produce. Also, chosing the \"best\" model is impossible for us, due to an obvious lack of ressources and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We eventually decided to choose the models based on an energy focus. We know how much energy cand resource consuming is the training of AI models nowadays. This pressing concern is largely discussed and raises questions about the ethical use of these tools. It made us think of trying to find the best working model out of the most reduced ones, that is, those with the less parameters, all for a purpose of saving time and ressources. We understood that by taking this decision, our final model would perform worse once updated to the leaderboard comapared to other, bigger models. We still decided to search between the couple rather small models in the PyTorch distribution, trying to come up with the one that is \"good enough\". The models we decided to test are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MobileNetV3-Small\n",
    "- ResNet-18\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately focused on these two architectures because they are not only computationally efficient but also well suited to multi-label image classification from an architectural standpoint. Also because we studied them in class (apart from EfficientNet, which was just mentioned). They have a small amount of parameters compared to other architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "MobileNetV3-Small was designed specifically for low-resource environments. Architecturally, it combines depthwise separable convolutions (greatly reducing the number of parameters and multiplications) with inverted residual blocks and linear bottlenecks, which mantain representational power while keeping the model extremely light. It also integrates squeeze-and-excitation attention blocks, improving the networkâs ability to focus on informative channels, something important in multi-label problems where several objects may share the image. Also, its small parameter count makes it fast to train and low on memory and energy cost. It has 3 million parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, ResNet-18 is a more classical but still efficient architecture that we studied in class. Its residual skip connections allow for deeper networks to train without vanishing gradients while still keeping the parameter count moderate compared to very deep ResNets and other models. Its parameter count is in the 11 million order. Although it uses standard convolutions (no depthwise separable trick), its straightforward structure is robust and proven for general image recognition. For a multi-label task, the residual connections help the model learn richer representations without becoming prohibitively heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We explicitly avoided architectures such as ConvNeXt, which, while state-of-the-art, are much deeper and more computationally expensive, and models like VGG or DenseNet, which are parameter-heavy with less efficient use of computation. Our three chosen models represent different CNN design evolutions: classic residual learning (ResNet-18), mobile-optimized depthwise convolutions (MobileNetV3), and balanced compound scaling (EfficientNet-B0). This mix gives us a practical space to experiment with accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs for our dataset while keeping training feasible and energy-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then chose which parameters we would focus on, before diving into the code and then the testing. There are a large number of parameters to experiment with when trying to perfectionate a model. We decided, again for a question of efficiency, to set a couple of them (the most impactufl) so we could make an honest study, avoiding changing of parameters between models. These are the parameters, which we divided into two sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- efficiency parameters:\n",
    "    - number of cpus\n",
    "    - batch size\n",
    "\n",
    "- learning parameters:\n",
    "    - number of epochs\n",
    "    - learning rate\n",
    "    - image size\n",
    "    - optimizer\n",
    "    - weight decay\n",
    "    - dropout layer\n",
    "    - threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the most important parameters in terms of impact in a model's behaviour. There is a larger number of them, but we don't have the time to make a big testing pool with all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then drew the lines for what would be our attack. We first set up our working environment, that is, setting up the 'Github' page for our code and a shared 'Drive' for our results (excel and word). We then needed to make a 'main.py' code for the training of our models, and a 'test.py' for the generation of the JSON file we would eventually upload to the leaderboard. The main modeules of the code were already given in this notebook. Then, each choosing one model, we would test its perfomance while modifying its parameters to find the best working one. "

In our experiments, the network outputs a probability for each possible label. By default, a label is considered present if its probability is â¥ 0,5. However, this fixed value does not necessarily mean the best trade-off between precision (proportion of predicted positives that are correct) and recall (proportion of true positives that are detected). We therefore performed a threshold sweep, testing several cut-off values from 0.05 to 0.95 on the validation set. Increasing the threshold makes the model predict a label only when it is more confident, which reduces false positives and generally improves precision, although it can slightly decrease recall. Conversely, lowering the threshold increases recall but often introduces more false positives, lowering precision. Selecting the threshold that maximized the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) allowed us to improve our modelâs validation performance without retraining. This simple post-processing step significantly increased precision and produced a better overall F1 balance for the multi-label task.\n",

    "\n",
    "ResNet-18 is a deep learning model with 18 layers and about 11.7M weights. It uses skip connections to train more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use it with the MS COCO dataset because itâs lightweight, fast, and still powerful enough to learn useful features from COCOâs large variety of images and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train this model we changed computeur to also test training with a faster computeur. We use an  an NVIDIA RTX A2000 8GB and I7 CPU\n",
    "#### Why we chose ResNet-18\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: ResNet-18 is computationally less demanding compared to deeper models, making it suitable for tasks requiring faster inference times. That means less Time to wait and less power consumtion it's a main value for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning: Pretrained ResNet-18 models on ImageNet can be fine-tuned for COCO, leveraging learned features for improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proven Architecture: ResNet architectures, including ResNet-18, have demonstrated strong performance in various vision tasks, including classification and detection.\n",

    "#### Let's Run it\n",
    "##### 1\n",
    "For the first run we will use the parameters used in mobileNet to have a base line and see what we can improve afterwars.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first run of ResNet18, we didnât freeze any model layers. For this initial test, we trained for 2 hours and achieved an F1 score of 0.42 after 10 epochs. The loss was still decreasing, so extending the number of epochs in the next run may improve results. We used a learning rate of 1e-4; increasing it to 1e-3 could allow for faster convergence.\n",

    "##### 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After a run freezing the backbone, we obtained an F1 score of 0.46. However, when training for 11 epochs, we achieved a better F1 score of 0.51. We also observed overfitting, accompanied by a decrease in accuracy. Therefore, we decided to reduce the number of epochs to 10, add a dropout layer of 0.4, and resize the images to 224. According to the ResNet-18 paper, this is the input size on which the network was originally trained, which can lead to better results through improved contextualization.\n",
    "The run with the dropout layer gave us an F1 score of 0.010 after 3 epochs so we decided to stop it.\n",

    "\n",
    "We decided as a future case of study to try other models results on this task. We tried EfficientNet-B0 and ConvNext.\n",
    "\n",
    "EfficientNet-B0 is built around the idea of compound scaling, where network depth, width, and input resolution are balanced using a single scaling coefficient. This avoids over-widening or over-deepening the network unnecessarily. Architecturally, it uses mobile inverted bottleneck convolution blocks with SE attention like MobileNetV3, but with a  deeper design that improves feature extraction while staying efficient. This is great for multi-label classification. It is a good balance between low computational work and big number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNeXt is a modern reinterpretation of the classic ResNet architecture, redesigned with ideas borrowed from Vision Transformers while keeping a fully convolutional backbone. It simplifies the traditional residual blocks into depthwise separable convolutions with large kernels (7Ã7), layer normalization instead of batch normalization, and inverted bottlenecks similar to those in efficient mobile models. This design improves the receptive field and feature extraction capacity while remaining computationally efficient compared to older CNNs. It is however a big model with a large number of parameters and a large computional time, which derives from our main approach to the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "We just wanted to compare our results with those of other models."
